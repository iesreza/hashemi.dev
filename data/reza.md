## About Me (With Jokes, But No Hard Words)

Hello! Call me **Reza**. Born in **Shiraz, Iran**, now in **Milan, Italy**. At **11**, I built my first commercial website for a football club and earned **$10**—felt like winning the World Cup. At **18**, I founded **SepehrIT** after meeting a co‑founder on **Yahoo Messenger**. Learned that software is 50% code and 50% patience.

I design systems end‑to‑end: from hardware to frontend. I don't lock myself to one stack. I pick the right tool and build things that run fast and run long.

> **I know how to deal with developers, databases, and CDNs.**

**Languages**: Farsi (native), English (fluent), Italian (pretty good after **5 years** and a lot of espresso)
**Education**: MSc in Computer Networks · BSc in Information Technology

## Skills

**Backend**: Golang (my main hammer), C#, PHP
**Databases**: MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, TiDB, Qdrant (vector DB)—schema design, indexing, replication, sharding, caching, tuning
**Networking**: Packet‑level work, firewalls, DNS, captive portals, traffic shaping
**Messaging**: NATS, Redis, Kafka—queues, backpressure, retries, idempotency
**Media**: FFmpeg for transcoding, ntopng for network metrics
**AI/ML**: RAG systems, embeddings, vector search, LLM integration, context-aware chatbots
**Other**: Medical automations, bio‑banks, digital hardware, low‑level programming

**Philosophy**: Keep it simple, make it fast, write it so future‑me says "thanks." I always try to keep up with edge technology.

## Notable Projects

* **Media Proxy** — Transcodes images/videos on the fly, generates thumbnails and previews. Saves bandwidth and keeps servers cool.
* **Seafy** — Maritime digital platform: internet access on vessels, distributed menus, vouchers, vessel tracking. Networks + edge computing on the sea.
* **PIVOT** — Scalable framework for OTT platforms and headless CMS. Content in, streams out, clean APIs.
* **EVO** — Golang app framework for building fast and clean services → [github.com/getevo](https://github.com/getevo/)
* **Indexeer** — Index, search, and chat with text, websites, audio, video, images. Uses Qdrant for vector search.
* **AI Chatbot Agent** — Retrieves customer data and acts to solve problems. Less "sorry" and more "here's the fix."

## What I Work With

**Go** (speed + single binary), **ClickHouse** (fast analytics), **NATS/Kafka** (reliable messaging), **Qdrant** (vector search), **Redis** (caching), **FFmpeg** (media magic)

I design high‑traffic systems with low latency and low cloud bills. I work with CDNs, edge nodes, caching layers, and databases (schema to migration). I've handled network tricks like captive portals and DNS interception. I've worked on medical automations and bio‑banks where accuracy matters. I also did digital hardware and firmware work.

I always try to keep up with **edge technology** and stay curious about what's next.
